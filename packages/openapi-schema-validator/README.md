> A validator for OpenAPI documents.

## Supported OpenAPI versions

* `v3`
* `v2` (formerly known as Swagger V2)

## Document examples and full specs:
* [Official 2.0 docs](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#itemsObject)
* [Official 3.0.0 docs](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md)

## Highlights

* Validate openapi documents against openapi schema documents.
* Uses [jsonschema](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema) under the hood.
* Performant.
* Currently supports type definitions included in the `definitions` property of the
provided openapi document.
* Extensively tested.
* Small footprint.

**Huge thank you to the [gnostic](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic) project for building up a 3.0.0 JSON schema.**


## Example
```javascript
var OpenAPISchemaValidator = require('openapi-schema-validator').default;
var validator = new OpenAPISchemaValidator({
  version: 2,
  // optional
  extensions: {
    /* place any properties here to extend the schema. */
  }
});
console.log(validator.validate(apiDoc));
```

* `version` _number_ openapi document schema version to use (2 or 3).
    * 2 - `openapi-2.0.0` (default)
    * 3 - `openapi-3.0.0`

[see here](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema#results) for example results.


## API
### .validate(apiDoc)
* `apiDoc` _object_ is any api document you wish to validate.
