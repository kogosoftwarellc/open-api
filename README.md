## Development

This monorepo uses lerna for development.  See the root package.json for helpful scripts.

### Typical Workflow for Contributors

Let's say you're working on a package under [./packages](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api/tree/master/packages).  Here's what you do:

1. `cd open-api`
1. `npm run bootstrap`
1. `npm t`
1. Make your changes.
  1. _Do not bump the version in package.json._  A maintainer will handle that once your PR is merged.
1. Once you're satisfied with your changes:
  1. Create a new branch `git checkout -b my-branch` (in case you haven't done so already).
  1. `./bin/commit packages/<package_you're_working_on> 'commit message describing your change.  can be multi line here.  just close with a single quote like so:'`
  1. Push your change to your fork
  1. Open a PR.

### bin

Several scripts have been created to aid in the development of this monorepo (see [./bin](./bin)).  They assume that your `$PWD` is the root of the repository.  Here is a brief summary of common actions:

* Commit changes to a package - `./bin/commit packages/<package_to_commit> 'Commit message'` (the commit message will be prepended with the package name e.g. `<package_to_commit>: Commit message`
* These reduce boilerplate and are called from npm scripts in leaf repos.
  * nyc
  * tsc
  * mocha
